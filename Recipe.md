Instructions
Preparation
First grease a round baking pan of 7.5 inches diameter x 2 inches height with sunflower oil.
Preheat your oven to 200 degrees celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit).
Sifting
Sieve whole wheat flour, salt, baking soda in a plate or bowl. Before sifting keep a plate, bowl or tray below the sieve. Use a good quality cocoa powder.
Place the sifted dry ingredients aside.
Making Liquid Mixture
In another pan or bowl, take the raw sugar.
Add cold water and stir with small whisk until all of the sugar dissolves.
Pour the sunflower oil. Stir briskly so that everything is mixed well and you get a homogenous mixture.
Next add the lemon juice and vanilla extract. Stir well again.
Making Chocolate Cake Batter
Add the sifted dry ingredients to the wet mixture. With a wired whisk, mix everything well.
Ensure that there are no lumps in the batter. This chocolate cake batter is slightly thin and not thick.
Pour the batter in the prepared pan.
Baking
Tap the sides of the pan so that the extra air bubbles are let out.
Bake in a preheated oven for 200 degrees Celsius (392 degrees Fahrenheit) for 35 to 40 mins. Since temperatures vary from oven to oven, do keep a check.
For baking in a convection mode of microwave oven, preheat the oven at 180 degrees celsius (356 degrees Fahrenheit) for 15 minutes. Then bake the cake at 180 degrees celsius (356 degree Fahrenheit) for 30 to 35 minutes.
For doneness check the cake with a bamboo skewer or toothpick. The skewer or toothpick should come out clean. Place the pan on a wired rack for the cake to cool.
Once the chocolate cake becomes cool at room temperature, remove it gently from the pan and place it on a wired rack. 
If the toothpick is sticky, then place the cake back in the oven and continue to bake for some more minutes. Before frosting let the chocolate cake cool completely.
Making Cocoa Frosting
Take the sunflower oil, almond milk and sugar in a small saucepan.
Keep the saucepan on a low heat and stirring often mix till the sugar is dissolved. Then add the cocoa powder. On a low heat stir and mix till all the cocoa powder is dissolved. Switch off the flame.
Frosting
While still hot, pour the frosting on the chocolate cake on the top and sides of the cake. Spread it evenly with an offset spatula. You can also slice the chocolate cake in halve and spread frosting in the center and then on the top. 
Usually I wrap a medium sized plate with aluminium foil and then keep the cake on it. This make the frosting work easier.
Keep the chocolate cake covered in the fridge for the frosting to set for a couple of hours. You can use a dome shaped bowl to cover the cake. Make sure the there is enough space between the cake and the bowl which you are using for covering the cake.
The frosting will set after some hours.
Next day, top the cake with some chocolate shavings or cacao shavings. You can also sprinkle some dry fruits or sprinkles. Some icing sugar and cocoa powder can also be sifted on the chocolate cake. This step is optional.
Slice and serve eggless chocolate cake as a sweet dessert.
Serving Suggestions
Serve the chocolate cake as it is as an after meal dessert or whenever the chocolate craving strike! Or for a luxurious treat, enjoy with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or some lightly sweetened whipped cream.
Storage
Place the remaining chocolate cake (whole or slices) in a covered box or container and refrigerate for a week.

Notes
Substitutions & Tips
For Lemon Juice: Instead of lemon juice, add the same quantity of white vinegar or apple cider vinegar.
For Baking Soda: You can use ½ to ⅔ teaspoon eno (fruit salt) instead of baking soda.
For Baking Powder: You cannot substitute baking powder with baking soda in this recipe. 
For Whole Wheat Flour: Swap with 1 cup of all-purpose flour (maida) or pastry flour. 
For Almond Milk: Instead of almond milk, add any nut milk or vegan milk to make the frosting. You can also add dairy milk. 
For Sunflower Oil: In place of sunflower oil use any neutral tasting oil. 
Cocoa Powder: Include the regular cocoa powder which is non-alkalized. Do not use dutch-process cocoa powder. 
Frosting: In the frosting, you can use dairy butter or vegan butter instead of sunflower oil. For a thick frosting, add less amount of almond milk. 
Sweeteners: For the sweeteners, you can choose to use raw sugar or white sugar or brown sugar. Avoid adding honey. According to Ayurveda, honey should not be heated as it becomes toxic. You can add jaggery, maple syrup, coconut sugar or palm sugar instead but the taste of the cake will be different.
Checking freshness of baking soda: Since baking soda is the only leavening ingredient, ensure that it is fresh. To check its freshness mix about ¼ to ½ teaspoon of baking soda in a solution of 1 tablespoon vinegar and 1 tablespoon of water. The solution should fizz and bubble. If the solution does not fizz and bubble, your baking soda is not active and fresh.
Baking: The temperature varies widely and differs from oven to oven. Generally it takes 35 minutes for this cake to bake. But if your oven is hotter or cooler, it will take less or more time. 
Scaling: The recipe can be easily scaled to make a small batch or a large batch for birthday parties.
